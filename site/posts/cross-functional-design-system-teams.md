# Cross functional design system teams

## What is a cross functional design system

Design systems that span on both mobile (iOS and android) and web are usually referred to as cross-functional design systems. These are more complex than design systems build for a specific platform because of the complexity that arises from designing and architecting components for different UI/UX constraints that arises dure to the platform constraints like for eg. Spinner on android is implemented completely different from iOS which uses are slot machines UI and this is different from web which uses a dropdown menu.
